# About

## Career

- **I have one year of experience** in the web development industry. I worked for a startup studio and was the developer and product manager for several companies within the studio.

- **I'm studying computer science.** I have three years of back-end development school projects, in C, C++, Java and Python. I have joined the startup speciality of my school. That allowed me to learn more about product management, UX design, Growth Hacking, VC's and more. I also met many startup CTOs and learned from their experiences.

- **I'm now looking for an internship** as a software engineer or a site reliability engineer for February 2023.

## Interests

- **I love listening to other people's experiences** and sharing my own! That's why I love reading books, articles and listening to podcasts.

- **I'm ambioustly focusing on learning**: I have uninstalled as much apps as I can on my phone. I have stopped video games, tv shows and social media. There is so much things that I want to learn, so I hate losing time.

- **I enjoy discovering**. I love playing with new technologies. I recently built my own nas/cloud solution and learned more about networking, deployment automation and scripting tools. I appreciate developping non technical skills. It can be anything: speak a new language, learn negociation, be a good mentor, get better at UX/UI design... I also like to meet new people! I can easily talk and exchange with anyone.

- I do sports. I did seven years of Karate, one year of light Krav Maga and I started weight training this year.
