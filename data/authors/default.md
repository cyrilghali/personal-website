# About

## Career

- **I'm a freelancer**. I have a year of experience in the web development industry. I worked for a startup studio and was the software engineer and product manager for several companies within the studio.

- **I'm studying computer science.** I have three years of back-end development school projects, in C, C++, Java and Python. I have joined the startup speciality of my school. That allowed me to learn more about product management, UX design, Growth Hacking, VC's and more. I also met many startup CTOs and learned from their experiences.

- **I challenged myself to became an entrepreneur.** I keep my eyes open on opportunies and try to make something people want.

## Interests

- **I love homelabbing**. The possibility to be the software engineer, sysadmin and sre of my own lab is just crazy. I can break things without worrying about it.

- **I like listening to other people's experiences** and sharing my own! That's why I read books, articles and listen to podcasts.

- **I'm ambioustly focusing on learning**: I have uninstalled as much apps as I can on my phone. I have stopped video games, tv shows and social media. There is so much things that I want to learn, so I hate losing time.

- I do sports. I did seven years of Karate, one year of light Krav Maga and I started weight training in 2022.
