I felt in the distro hopping. Many times. One of my concerns about Ubuntu was that you don't really choose what you install on your machine. They provide you with a ready-made environment, and that bothered me because there are so many flaws and applications that I didn't want. Especially since, I want to install i3wm and no other desktop on my machine. So here are some steps to have an Ubuntu 8gb installation with i3wm.

## Guide

#### 1. Install Ubuntu Server on your machine

#### 2. Update the machine and upgrade it with

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

#### 3. Install your favorite shell. (optional)

```
sudo apt install zsh
```

Change the default:

```
chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh
```

#### 4. Weâ€™ll need a display server so letâ€™s install the one most widely used; Xorg:

```
sudo apt install xinit
```

#### 5. Adding a terminal emulator

I pesonally picked rxvt-unicode.

```
sudo apt install rxvt-unicode.
```

#### 6. You can change your terminal colors, here is the command for rxvt (optional)

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/base16-templates/base16-xresources/master/xresources/base16-material-darker.Xresources >> ~/.Xresources

echo "URxvt.font: xft:DejaVuSansMono:size=10" >> ~/.Xresources
```

#### 7. Install your favorite desktop manager

```
sudo apt install i3
```

#### 8. Start X

```
startx
```

#### 9. Load your .Xresources

```
sudo apt install x11-xserver-utils
xrdb -load ~/.Xresources
```

#### Bonus

I personally use proxmox. I'm gonna install rdp so I can access to my machine remotely:

```
sudo apt install xrdp -y
sudo adduser xrdp ssl-cert
sudo systemctl restart xrdp
sudo systemctl enable --now xrdp
```

Congrats ðŸŽ‰
