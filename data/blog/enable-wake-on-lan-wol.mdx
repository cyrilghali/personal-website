Wake on LAN is very useful functionality if your hardware supports it.
Make sur it's enable on your BIOS.

# install ethtool

```
sudo apt install ethtool
```

# list network devices

```
ip addr
```

Look for the device that has your local IP address (192.168 or 10.10). Take the mac address.

# replace eno1 with the device name to test

```
sudo ethtool eno1
```

Find `Supports Wake-on line`
If it contains a `g` it supports WOL.

# enable wol on the device

sudo ethtool -s eno1 wol g

# edit the network interfaces configuration

```
sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces
```

Paste the following below the iface of your ip address
`ethernet-wol g`

Shutdown the device and test it. Congrats ðŸŽ‰
