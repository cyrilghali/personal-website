Wake on LAN is very useful functionality if your hardware supports it.
Make sur it's enable on your BIOS.

Here is how to enable it on a Debian machine

### install ethtool

```
sudo apt install ethtool
```

### list network devices

```
ip addr
```

Look for the device that has your local IP address (192.168 or 10.10). Take the mac address.

### replace eno1 with your iface

```
sudo ethtool eno1
```

Find `Supports Wake-on line`
If it contains a `g` it supports WOL.

### enable wol on the device

```
sudo ethtool -s eno1 wol g
```

### edit the network interfaces configuration

```
sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces
```

Paste `ethernet-wol g` below the iface of your ip address

Shutdown the device and test it. Congrats 🎉
