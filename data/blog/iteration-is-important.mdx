A few months ago, I started thinking about creating a portfolio; I thought I should build the best portfolio I could with the cleanest code that could be built.
I was at the extreme of perfectionism. The result: I had nothing to show for it and felt uncomfortable.
One of the first things I did was compare myself to other developers, with their 100+ page repositories and 2,000+ stars on GitHub.
_The impostor syndrome enters the scene_. Seeing other Gitub profiles that look so clean pushed me to the limit of my perfectionism. I deleted every project I had because the code wasn't clean.
So please don't do that. **Iterate**. Start somewhere, and keep improving over time. It takes time to build beautiful things.
