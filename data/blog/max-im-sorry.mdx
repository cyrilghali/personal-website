A few months ago, I started thinking about creating a portfolio so I could show my work to technical interviewers.
I thought I needed to build the best portfolio possible with the cleanest code that could be built.
I was (and still am) at the extreme of perfectionism. The result: I had nothing to show for it and felt uncomfortable.<br /><br />
One of the first things I did was compare myself to other developers, with their 30+ repositories and 2,000+ stars on github.
Seeing other github profiles that look so clean motivates me to do it, but it pushed me to the edge of my perfectionism.
Every project starts to mean nothing to me, like it's not good enough to show anyone. But in fact, it is.
I'm a junior software engineer. I have to be hard on myself, but not **_that hard_**.
One day, with a lot of effort and headaches, I will get there. I will make software that people will love to use. But until that day comes, I will show the good, the bad and the ugly of all my projects.
I'll focus on what needs to be done: getting better, continuing to learn, and not being interested in the Github profile fame game. <br /><br />
So here are [my first lines of code on Github](https://github.com/datscyril/cameleon).
For the record, this was a school project in 2019, the code was not clean. I hadn't even heard of clean code at the time.
I was mixing non-explicit variable names in French and English.
I had left too many comments. 500 lines of code in a single file. I didn't know git, unit testing, TDD, Agile or pair programming.
I was really excited about the project, rushed it in two weeks and didn't give my colleague a chance to write a single line of code.
By rushing the project, I probably distracted him from programming and if that's the case, Max, my friend, I'm sorry.

However, There is nothing to be ashamed of with this project, because **I had to learn and start somewhere**,
and I am still learning today. Especially since at the time, we got a very good grade on this school
project, there is nothing to hide. So here's what I learned:

- Show your work! Even if it's not perfect! You will be surprised by your progress over time.
- If you are a perfectionist, don't look for the best. Look for what is convenient and good enough. Go at your own pace, focus on what matters most.

Thank you for reading!
