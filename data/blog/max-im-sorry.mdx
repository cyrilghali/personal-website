summary: Why I chose to publish my first programming project on GitHub, how bad perfectionism is and why I feel sorry for my colleague.

A few months ago, I started thinking about building a portfolio so I could show my work to technical interviewers.
I thought I needed to build the best possible portfolio with the cleanest code that could be built.
I was (and still am) at the extreme of perfectionism. The result: I had nothing to show for it and felt uncomfortable.
One of the first things I did was compare myself to other developers, with their github of 100+ repositories and 5,000+ stars.
I was ashamed of my project's commits description.
I followed some tutorials to create google, amazon, airbnb clones, so I could get side projects easily, but nothing can make you feel more guilty than following a step by step tutorial.
So that's why I published [my first lines of code on Github](https://github.com/datscyril/cameleon).
That's the work I did to get where I am today.
At the time, I was mixing non-explicit variable names in French and English. I had left too many comments.
500 lines of code in a file. I didn't know unit testing, TDD or Agile.
I rushed the project in two weeks and didn't give my colleague a chance to write a single line of code and give him time to learn.
I probably turned him off of programming, and if so I'm sorry.
However, I have nothing to be ashamed of with this project, because **I had to learn and start somewhere**, and I am still learning today.
This is my story, who I was, and I have nothing to be ashamed of. Especially since at the time, we had a very good grade on this school project.

So my point is this:

- Show your work, even if it's not perfect, we get better with time.
- Don't look for the best, but see if it's enjoyable. I've made this mistake many times and wasted a lot of time with it
