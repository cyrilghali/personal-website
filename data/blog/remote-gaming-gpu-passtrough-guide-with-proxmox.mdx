They are multiple ways to achieve what we are building today. You can at first, just use your gaming machine as it is. Install Parsec or Moonlight, reverse proxying the traffic to that machine or use a VPN, and then you are ready to go. But I found it more funnier to have windows installed in a VM, since I use windows only for gaming, and nothing else.

Today, we are building a W11 VM on Proxmox 7, where you can passtrough you GPU to W11, and play games on your own cloud !

# Windows VM.

On your pool storge, you should download 2 things:

- Windows 11 iso
- Latest virtio-win drivers iso.

Create your VM, ensure that you choose any option that is VirtIO related, enable TPM, give enough memory and cores to your machine, and before starting the machine, ensure to add the virtio win iso to the VM.

Ensure that you have RDP or any other remote control software installed, because you won't be able to use VNC after using your GPU as your primary card.

Check your kernel version because most of the guides are deprecated by now.

## Steps

Edit `/etc/default/grub`. Change this line:

```
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet amd_iommu=on video=vesafb:off video=efifb:off"
```

Run `update-grub`:

```
update-grub
```

Run `reboot`:

```
reboot
```

Edit `/etc/modules/`:

```
vfio
vfio_iommu_type1
vfio_pci
vfio_virqf
```

Run `reboot`:

```
reboot
```

In `/etc/pve/qemu-server/XXX.conf` (The VM id of your machine)

Replace the CPU line by this one:

```
cpu: host,hidden=1,flags=+pci
```

Here is my config if you want to have a look:

```
agent: 1
bios: ovmf
boot: order=virtio0;net0;ide2;ide0
cores: 8
cpu: host,hidden=1,flags=+pcid
efidisk0: ssd:vm-100-disk-0,efitype=4m,pre-enrolled-keys=1,size=4M
hostpci0: 0000:2d:00,pcie=1,x-vga=1
ide0: local:iso/virtio-win.iso,media=cdrom,size=519172K
ide2: local:iso/Win11_English_x64v1.iso,media=cdrom,size=5434622K
machine: pc-q35-6.1
memory: 16384
meta: creation-qemu=6.1.0,ctime=1654853116
name: backupw11
net0: virtio=16:DB:69:5D:5F:99,bridge=vmbr0,firewall=1
numa: 0
ostype: win11
scsihw: virtio-scsi-pci
smbios1: uuid=8e0ad09d-2a10-4368-9d2c-a599397f2083
sockets: 1
tpmstate0: ssd:vm-100-disk-1,size=4M,version=v2.0
virtio0: ssd:vm-100-disk-2,size=128G
vmgenid: 03172900-0ee8-4f6d-acef-846cf7bf9810
```

blacklists the drivers:

```
echo "blacklist radeon" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
echo "blacklist nouveau" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
echo "blacklist nvidia" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
```

Create this file

```
echo "options vfio-pci ids=10de:1381,10de:0fbc" > /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf
```

where XXXX:XXXX is the device and vendor id of your gpu. Find them with `lspci-nn`.

This will output something like:

```
01:00.0 0300: 10de:1381 (rev a2)
01:00.1 0403: 10de:0fbc (rev a1)
```

Add you GPU card in proxmox to the vm by adding a pci device. Check everything (Primary GPU, All functions, Rom-bar, Pci express)

You can start your vm, connect it with the remote software that you have chosen, and install the nvidia drivers.

To make sure that your NVIDIA card is working, you can open Nvidia Control Panel, go to 'adjust image settings with preview' and check if the 3D rendering is working.
