I was always on social media, sometimes 4 hours a day. I felt guilty for not being productive.
So I decided to get off social media. How? **I unsubscribed from everyone** on all social networks.
I was too lazy to subscribe to people again. I wasn't learning anything worth my time. The habit of going on social media apps was still there, but you leave immediately because there is nothing to see here.
I'm in the process of relearning how to use that time properly. I've deleted Snapchat, TikTok, and Instagram. My Facebook account is still there but I don't go on it anymore. I have unsubscribed from everyone on Linkedin, Twitter and YouTube. I use a browser extension called Unhook to remove recommendations from YouTube.

We live in an age where content is created everywhere by everyone. So instead of letting content
come to me, I prefer to look for the info when I need it. I also turned off as many notifications as
possible on my phone so I wouldn't get distracted. I try to use this free time properly. I feel
better that way. I did it because it works for me. If you are productive while having then in your
time, then good for you! You don't have to do what I did. If you need more advice do not hesitate to
contact me.

Thanks for your read !

## Bonus:

Here's a mini tutorial if you want to unsubscribe from everyone on Linkedin.

1. Visit www.linkedin.com/feed/following.
2. Open the Dev Tools of your browser (Click, Inspect and switch to the console tab);
3. Paste the script to the console and press enter.
4. Please wait for the script to do its job.

If the script breaks in the middle, reload the page and repeat the process until the following count reaches zero and LinkedIn displays ‘Follow Fresh Perspectives’.

```js
(() => {
  let count = 0
  function getAllButtons() {
    return document.querySelectorAll('button.is-following') || []
  }
  async function unfollowAll() {
    const buttons = getAllButtons()

    for (let button of buttons) {
      count = count + 1

      const name = button.parentElement.querySelector(
        '.follows-recommendation-card__name'
      ).innerText
      console.log(`Unfollow #${count}:`, name)

      window.scrollTo(0, button.offsetTop - 260)
      button.click()

      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100))
    }
  }
  async function run() {
    await unfollowAll()
    window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight)
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
    const buttons = getAllButtons()
    if (buttons.length) run()
  }
  run()
})()
```
